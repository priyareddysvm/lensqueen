		<p>I've been a working photographer for over 10 years, and I've had a chance to work on a wide range of assignments. From working 			
		with one of India's largest volunteer organisations to document their work across India, shooting with a leading sports brand with 			
		the world's fastest man, creating content with the world's leading smartphone manufacturer or shooting international travel shows 			
		across the world, I've always worked hard to create aesthetic visual imagery with compelling stories. In my portfolio you will find 		
		images from my different assignments, along with ongoing personal projects.
